# Exercise 6: Popular Baby Names Over Time

# Read in the female baby names csv file into a variable called `female.names`
female.names <- read.csv('data/female_names.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
View(female.names)
# Create a vector `year` as the year column of the dataset
year <- female.names$year

# Create a vector `name` as the name column of the datset
# As in the last exercise, you'll need to convert this column to a vector
name <- female.names$name

# Create a vector `prop` as the proportion column of the dataset
prop <- female.names$prop

# Create a vector `names.2013` as your name vector where your year vector is 2013
name.2013 <- name[year == 2013]

# Create a vector `prop.2013` as the your prop vector where your year vecctor is 2013
prop.2013 <- prop[year == 2013]

# What was the most popular female name in 2013?
most.pop <- name.2013[prop.2013 == max(prop.2013)]

# Write a funciton `MostPopular` that takes in a value `my.year`, and returns
# a sentence stating the most popular name in that year. 


# What was the most popular female name in 1994?


### Bonus ###

# Write a function `HowPopular` that takes in a name and a year, and returns
# a sentence with how popular that name was in that year
